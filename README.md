# Ali Raza (Amr Shah)

Product-Focused Technical Architect \| Backend Systems Engineer

I architect scalable business systems and build product-ready backend
platforms with over 17 years of experience across enterprise software,
SaaS systems, accounting engines, and distributed computing
environments.

My work sits at the intersection of:

• Software Architecture\
• Product-Oriented System Design\
• Commercially Scalable Platforms

I design systems not just to function --- but to evolve into
sustainable, maintainable products.

## Core Focus

-   Vertical SaaS architecture (Practice, Distribution, Education
    systems)
-   Modular accounting engines (Tally-inspired ledger & voucher
    structures)
-   Multi-tenant SaaS infrastructure
-   Advanced RBAC / Attribute-Based Access Control
-   Enterprise workflow automation
-   AI-integrated backend systems
-   Cost-optimized model orchestration & automation pipelines

## Current Work: Multi-Agent Orchestration (MAO)

Currently researching and building modular Multi-Agent Orchestration
(MAO) systems designed to automate structured operational workflows
while maintaining Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) governance.

Focus areas include:

-   Modular agent pipelines for content, operations, and structured
    workflows
-   Coordination between autonomous agents and supervisory checkpoints
-   Stateful orchestration patterns for multi-step business processes
-   Integration between traditional backend systems (Laravel/PHP) and
    modern LLM-based agent frameworks

This work is in active experimentation and structured prototype
development, with plans to open-source selected components as they
mature.

## Engineering Philosophy

Structure before scale.\
Ownership before comfort.\
Clarity in domain modeling before implementation.\
Long-term leverage over short-term output.
