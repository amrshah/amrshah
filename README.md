# Ali Raza — Software Architect & Senior Backend Engineer

I am a software architect and backend-focused engineer with over 17 years of experience designing reliable APIs, enterprise web platforms, and accounting systems. My work spans backend architecture, Laravel/PHP development, system design, and leading small engineering teams to deliver stable, maintainable, and production-ready software.

I’ve contributed across product development, consulting, enterprise platforms, and academic environments, including teaching advanced computing (Parallel & Distributed Computing, CUDA, HPC). I enjoy simplifying complex business domains, designing practical architectures, and building systems that continue to work long after delivery.
