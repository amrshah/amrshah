# Ali Raza — Software Architect & Senior Backend Engineer

I am a software architect and backend-focused engineer with over 17 years of experience designing reliable APIs, enterprise web platforms, and accounting systems. My work spans backend architecture, Laravel/PHP development, system design, and leading small engineering teams to deliver stable, maintainable, and production-ready software.

I’ve contributed across product development, consulting, enterprise platforms, and academic environments, including teaching advanced computing (Parallel & Distributed Computing, CUDA, HPC). I enjoy simplifying complex business domains, designing practical architectures, and building systems that continue to work long after delivery.

## Areas of Focus

- Backend architecture and API design using Laravel and PHP  
- Accounting and financial systems (Tally-inspired structures, ledgers, vouchers)  
- Enterprise web applications, custom CMS/SaaS platforms, and workflow automation  
- Refactoring, stability improvements, and long-term maintainability  
- Team leadership, code reviews, mentoring, and delivery management  
- Distributed systems and high-performance computing foundations (MPI, OpenMP, CUDA)

## Professional Philosophy

I focus on building systems that are clear in purpose, consistent in design, and dependable in production. Good engineering is not just code — it’s understanding the domain deeply, designing the right abstractions, and ensuring the system remains maintainable long after delivery.

## Current Research & Work in Progress: Multi-Agent Orchestration (MAO)

I am currently working on Multi-Agent Orchestration (MAO) systems to automate complex business workflows for digital marketing agencies and other operationally heavy industries. The goal is to design agentic pipelines that combine automated intelligence with Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) oversight to ensure accuracy, adaptability, and business alignment.

My focus areas include:

- Designing modular agent workflows for content generation, campaign setup, and operational execution  
- Coordinating autonomous agents with supervisory agents and HITL checkpoints  
- Defining orchestration patterns for multi-step, stateful business processes  
- Integrating traditional backend systems (Laravel/PHP) with modern LLM-based agent frameworks  
- Building a long-term system capable of operating 70–90% of a company’s routine workflows in a semi-autonomous mode

This is an ongoing project with active experimentation and prototype development.  
I plan to open-source parts of the orchestration framework and tooling as they mature.
